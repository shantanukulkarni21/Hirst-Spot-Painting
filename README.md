Hirst Spot Painting Program

Damien Steven Hirst is an English artist, entrepreneur, and art collector. He is reportedly the United Kingdom's richest living artist.
Since 1986, Damien Hirst has produced over 1,000 spot paintings. The dots, which may appear machine-made but are each done by hand, 
celebrate technical precision and the simple joys of color. 

This program uses the turtle module to recreate a 10 x 10 spot painting using random colors from an image.
The program contains rgb_to_color(tup) function which allows us to return a string of rgb values which are then inputed to the 
turtle's dot method.
